          <p class="lead">
Recent advances in nanotechnology have enabled researchers to control individual quantum mechanical objects with unprecedented accuracy, opening the door for both quantum and extreme-scale conventional computing applications. As these devices become larger and more complex, the ability to design them for simple control becomes a daunting and computationally infeasible task. Here, motivated by ideas from compressed sensing, we introduce a protocol for Compressed Optimization of Device Architectures (CODA). It leads naturally to a metric for benchmarking device performance and optimizing device designs, and provides a scheme for automating the control of gate operations and reducing their complexity. Because CODA is both experimentally and computationally efficient, it is readily extensible to large systems.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Capacitively Coupled Qubits</h2>
          <p class="lead">The successful implementation of single-qubit gates in the quantum dot hybrid qubit motivates our interest in developing a high fidelity two-qubit gate protocol. Recently, extensive work has been done to characterize the theoretical limitations and advantages in performing two-qubit operations at an operation point located in the charge transition region. Additionally, there is evidence to support that single-qubit gate fidelities improve while operating in the so-called ``far-detuned" region, away from the charge transition. Here we explore the possibility of performing two-qubit gates in this region, considering the challenges and the benefits that may present themselves while implementing such an operational paradigm.

          <p class="lead">
Many cutting-edge experiments in silicon-based devices for quantum information processing involve the tunneling of an individual electron from a donor atom within the material to the interface of the heterostructure. Understanding how this tunneling process varies among different realistic devices is therefore of great interest. Using a multi-valley effective mass approximation method, we find the tunnel coupling, adiabatic min-gap, and ionizing electric field strength between a phosphorous donor in silicon and a nearby quantum dot at a Si/SiO2 interface. Additionally, we calculate these quantities for a phosphorous donor in strained silicon and a Si/SiGe interface. We consider how these properties change as a function of relative position between the donor and the dot.
