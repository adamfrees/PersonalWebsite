          <p class="lead">
My appreciation for the sciences really began in high school. For as long as I can remember, I was always interested in math and computer science, but for some reason I had written off the hard sciences as something that just werenâ€™t for me. In my high school physics class, though, I was introduced to topics like quantum mechanics, black holes, and entropy. These were things that I had heard about in science fiction books and movies, but had never considered topics that scientists really studied. This was the first step in what would become my career as a physicist.
My high school experience opened my eyes to the possibility of studying physics, which by the end of my freshman year of college had become my academic focus. At Brown University, I was given the opportunity to explore many different fields during my freshman year, eventually leading me to be convinced that I was most interested in studying physics. At the beginning of my sophomore year I declared my major, and the following spring went to study at Huboldt University in Berlin. Studying abroad was an incredibly valuable experience for me; learning in a culture different from my own imparted on me the importance of considering the global impact of my decisions, a lesson that I intend to keep with me throughout my career.
Another ideal that has been a major part of my career so far has been a dedication to teaching. My love for teaching began in high school, where I volunteered as a tutor for my peers. This is an activity which I continued through college and am still active in today. When students reach out initially, they are often overwhelmed and frustrated with physics as a subject, so it is always incredibly rewarding when, after a few sessions, I can see the material begin to click for them. As a graduate student, I also worked as a teaching assistant for an introductory physics class for engineers. This was rewarding in a different way, as I was exposed to teaching students that were more naturally excited about the material. The experience greatly improved my ability to speak with larger groups, as well as my ability to balance the issues of individual students with the needs of the larger class.</p>
